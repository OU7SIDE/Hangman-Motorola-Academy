Recently I graduated from electronic technical high school in the field of IT
I got interested in programming in my high school and that is where I had my first expierience with C++ and JavaScript.
I am eager to learn but for now I am at the begining of my programming journey and I couldn't manage to do the task therefore I am sending you the part that I did.
